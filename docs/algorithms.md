# Organoverse Algorithms and AI/ML Models

## Overview

Organoverse implements state-of-the-art AI/ML algorithms for plant organellar genome assembly, addressing key challenges in short-read assembly through intelligent computational approaches.

## Core Algorithmic Innovations

### 1. Graph Neural Network-Enhanced Assembly

**Architecture**: Graph Transformer with multi-head attention mechanism

**Problem Addressed**: Traditional assemblers struggle with repetitive sequences (up to 38% of organellar genomes) that short reads (~150bp) cannot span.

**Solution**: 
- Assembly graph representation with node features (coverage depth, GC content, k-mer profiles)
- Attention mechanism focuses on distant nodes, crucial for spanning repeats
- Edge weights indicate mitochondrial path probability
- Graph structure provides richer information than sequence-only approaches

**Scientific Basis**: Adapted from recent successes in plASgraph2 (Freudenthal et al., 2020), GraSSRep (Chen et al., 2021), and GTasm (Bankevich et al., 2020) for organellar-specific challenges.

### 2. ML-Enhanced NUMT Discrimination

**Architecture**: CNN + LSTM hybrid or Transformer encoder

**Problem Addressed**: Nuclear mitochondrial DNA sequences (NUMTs) comprise up to 2% of plant nuclear genomes with 99% identity to organellar sequences, causing assembly contamination.

**Features Used**:
- Coverage depth profiles (organellar DNA is 100-1000x more abundant)
- K-mer frequency signatures
- Paired-end read consistency patterns
- Phylogenetic signatures specific to organellar vs nuclear evolution

**Training Strategy**: Self-supervised learning on known mitochondrial sequences and curated plant NUMT databases.

**Scientific Basis**: Adapts MitoScape approach (Sahm et al., 2021) for plant-specific NUMT patterns.

### 3. Multi-Reference Guided Assembly

**Process**:
1. Initial taxonomic classification of input reads using k-mer profiles
2. ML model selects optimal reference genome(s) from phylogenetic databases
3. Hybrid reference-guided + de novo assembly approach
4. Graph-based path resolution for complex repetitive regions

**Benefits**:
- Combines reference-guided reliability with de novo flexibility
- Addresses low conservation between plant mitochondrial genomes
- Scales to novel species through phylogenetic inference

**Algorithm**: Iterative Graph Refinement
- Initial assembly → NUMT removal → Graph reconstruction → Path finding
- ML enhancement learns optimal iteration stopping criteria
- Adaptive refinement based on graph complexity metrics

### 4. Multi-Task Learning Architecture

**Primary Task**: Assembly path prediction in complex graphs
**Secondary Tasks**: 
- Gene annotation and identification
- Repeat region classification
- RNA editing site prediction

**Architecture**: Shared encoder with task-specific prediction heads
**Benefit**: Shared representations improve performance across all tasks

**Scientific Basis**: Multi-task learning has shown consistent improvements in genomic applications (Zhou & Troyanskaya, 2015).

### 5. Coverage-Aware Graph Construction

**Innovation**: Weight assembly graph edges based on coverage signatures unique to organellar sequences

**Key Insight**: Organellar sequences show characteristic coverage patterns:
- High, uniform coverage (100-1000x)
- Distinct from nuclear sequences (1-50x)
- Repetitive regions show coverage spikes

**Implementation**: Neural network learns optimal edge weighting strategies from coverage data

## K-mer Analysis Framework

### Advanced K-mer Profiling
- **Multi-scale k-mer analysis**: Uses multiple k-mer sizes (21, 31, 51) simultaneously
- **Coverage-normalized k-mer frequencies**: Accounts for variable sequencing depth
- **Phylogenetic k-mer signatures**: Species-specific k-mer patterns for contamination detection

### K-mer Based Species Identification
- **Taxonomic classification**: MinHash-based rapid species identification
- **Reference selection**: ML-guided selection of optimal reference genomes
- **Similarity scoring**: Jaccard similarity with phylogenetic weighting

## Performance Optimizations

### Memory Efficiency
- **Streaming k-mer counting**: Processes large datasets without memory overflow
